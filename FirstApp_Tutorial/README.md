# First application

In this little [tutorial]([https://github.com/NicolasDuponchel/TeachingAndroid/tree/master/MyFirstApp](https://github.com/NicolasDuponchel/TeachingAndroid/tree/master/MyFirstApp)), we can learn the basics of Kotlin and how to create an application using Android Studio.
I was able to familiarize with Kotlin and see how more intuitive it is to use compared to Java. I also learned how to implement a constraint layout and see how views can interact with each other with a button.
